<p>At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.</p>

<h6 class="NORA">NORA</h6>
<p>Thanks; put it on the table.</p>

<p>But it is very much in want of mendingz.</p>

<h6 class="NORA">NORA</h6>
<p></p>I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.</p>

<h6 class="NURSE">NURSE</h6>
<p></p>What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.</p>

<h6 class="NORA">NORA</h6>
<p></p>Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.</p>

<h6 class="NURSE">NURSE</h6>
